Swift Calculator 🧮

This project is a simple calculator app built with Swift and SwiftUI.

It is one of my first projects in Swift, created specifically to get familiar with:

Swift syntax and logic
SwiftUI fundamentals
State management
Basic UI layout and user interaction

This project is not meant to be complex or production-ready. Its purpose is learning, experimentation, and building solid foundations before moving on to more advanced apps.

Why this project exists

I built this calculator as a hands-on way to understand Swift rather than just reading documentation or tutorials.

The focus was on:
Writing real Swift code
Understanding how SwiftUI views update
Learning how an app is structured in Xcode
Getting comfortable pushing and managing projects on GitHub

Tech Stack
Language: Swift
Framework: SwiftUI
Platform: iOS / macOS (depending on your target)

Status
✅ Completed as a learning project
🔧 May be refactored or extended later as my Swift skills grow

Notes
This repository is part of my personal learning journey.

More advanced projects will follow as I dive deeper into Swift, app architecture, and Apple platforms.
